    "Restaurants are usually located at the last part of a very long supply chain, consisting of various vendors. This chain usually begins with raw material producers such as farms,then connects to intermediaries such as logistics and distribution companies, and ultimately to restaurants. One of the most crucial challenges of food supply distributors is to locate the best urban spot which is close enough to the targeted restaurants and is far enough from the neighborhoods with higher land values. There are many other factors such as closeness to highways and train stations, presence of particular municipal regulations and the intrinsic structure of the logistic facilities, which are in part influencing the final decision for locating the distribution facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini project, I would try to find the optimum location for the final dispatching station by clustering neighborhoods based on particular type of the restaurant. For this reason, I will use the foursquare's API endpoints to assign the most frequent type of the restaurant to each neighborhood. Then, by means of the Kmeans clustering method, I will recommend the best neighborhoods to locate the distribution stations for each type of resturants supply providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, we will have a ranked list of neighborhoods based on approximity to a particular type of the resturants. This list also can be used as a guide for tourists who are interested in a specific type of foods and cuisines for planning and accomodation purposes. Also entrepreneurs can benefit from knowing neighborhoods with higher density of each type of resturants. They can plan to establish their own resturant, or provide specific services."

    "To cluster the neighborhoods based on the intensity of special type of resturants, a Kmeans clustering algorithm has been used. Kmeans is a method of vector quantization to cluster the points of data based on the distance from centroids. \n",
    "To popluate the features, first, using the \"explore\" endpoint from Foursquare API, we create a list of ranked resturant type for each neighobrhood. Then by doing one-hot coding, a vector space consisting of standardize values for each neighberhood is created. The final matrix is used to cluster the observations."

    "This study is largly limited to the possible venue suggestions from Foursquare website. The quality and quantity of the features can be increased by using the premium account. The clusters are also largly influenced by the K values and other parameters. To get the best results, results from other clustering methods could be compared and the most accurate clustering methods selected. Since the positioning of the vectors could be so diverse, a density based clustering method"
